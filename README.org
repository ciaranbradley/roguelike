#+TITLE: Rogue

Personal Emacs configuration using Emacs 29 defaults and modern packages. My
older config was build around 2017-2018 using spacemacs, you can find that in
the ~spacemacs~ branch.

* Themes

[[file:./screens/light.png]]

/Dark theme is a work in progress./

These themes are built on [[https://github.com/doomemacs/themes][doom-themes]] framework and can also be used
independently as but you would need other assistive elisp in this config to
recreate the above looks.

Also the following fonts are needed for this set up:
1. Iosevka
2. Merriweather
3. EtBembo
4. Source Sans Pro
